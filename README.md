## Usage

- **India has numerous engineering colleges, predominantly offering B.Tech programs, but the quality of education is often subpar.**

- **A significant issue is the focus on profit-making over providing quality education; colleges are more interested in generating revenue.**
- **Examples like GITA Autonomous College, Bhubaneswar, highlight how some professors prioritize collecting money over teaching.**
- **Some colleges resort to unethical practices, such as offering money to students who recruit others, perpetuating a cycle of financial exploitation.**
- **Engineering colleges, instead of imparting education, leave students resorting to self-learning through online platforms like YouTube and Udemy.**
- **The YouTube channel "APNA College" targets students from tier 3 colleges, recognizing the lack of quality education in these institutions.**
- **Despite the desire for a social life and enjoyment in college, students must remember the substantial financial investment they are making in their education.**
- **It is advisable for students to choose colleges wisely, considering government institutions or supplementing their learning through online resources if quality education is lacking.**space. You may also link to more resources.
